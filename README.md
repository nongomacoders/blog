a blog built from scratch to allow newbies to practice coding

My apologies to those who submitted pull requests.

This account is mainly to help rural South African kids.

They are meant to work on issues and submit pull requests.

So regretfully it will be too confusing to accept PR from others.

Thank you for your understanding.
